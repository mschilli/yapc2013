This is a demo to show how to split a test suite into a unit test
(run locally on the devbox) and an integration test (run in a vagrant
VM with the LIVE env variable set.

After building via

    perl Makefile.PL

you can run 

    make test

and see that the live test is skipped locally:

    t/Live.t .. skipped: only with LIVE
    t/Unit.t .. ok   

When you run

    make livetest

on the other hand, you'll see (given that a vagrant VM named 'ubuntu2'
is available as a box, change the Vagrantfile isf this is different
in your dev environment):

    t/Live.t .. ok
    t/Unit.t .. ok
    All tests successful.
    Files=2, Tests=2,  0 wallclock secs ( 0.04 usr  0.04 sys +  0.06 cusr  0.01 csys =  0.15 CPU)
    Result: PASS

Note how both the unit and tthe LIVE tests have been run in the VM.
