"Continuously integrating Perl projects with Vagrant"

Mike Schilli, Venkat Venkateraju

To make sure your Perl applications really install and work in new
environments, they need to be tested in VMs created from scratch. But unless
test and staging environments can be spun up quickly, automatically, and
reproducably, that's not going to happen. Vagrant, a VM command line frontend,
and provisioning tools like Puppet/Chef/Salt let you store your test VM
configurations in your source control system alongside with your project, and
make sure they evolve in lockstep.
